To install the submit scripts, run 'sudo rake'.

If using rvm (not on the VM), run 'rvmsudo rake'.

After successfully running the rake task, run 'submit-config' and enter your email and submission password (this only needs to be done once ever).

To submit assignments, 'submit <assignment-part sid> <file to submit>'
